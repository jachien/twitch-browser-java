improvement: update manage games ui
bug: when managing games, if you type the full game name and press enter, it does nothing.
    It should either 
    a) indicate that there's no matching game
    OR 
    b) find a matching game from the autocomplete list and save it
bug: if no streams found, displays text thinking you have no games added
improvement: better first visit experience with selecting games to follow
improvement: add inline showing or hiding of streams by game
improvement: make front page prettier
improvement: google account integration
improvement: stream favoriting / ignoring
